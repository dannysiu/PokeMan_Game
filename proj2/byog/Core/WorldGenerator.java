     *  @Source friend and classmate Andrew Chen. He told us how his partner and him conceptually built
     *  their world.
     *
     *  Explanation of why change: Our plan changed on Tuesday, roughly 12 PM (after Phase 1 supposed to be due).
     *  Original plan was a branching-tree algorithm starting with a single random room, and building hallways
     *  off of it that would randomly turn, continue, dead-end, or build a room at the end of them.
     *  Ran into bugs with algorithm to randomly decide how to turn and build hallways, decided to switch to
     *  a simpler approach (considering we were already past the deadline).
     *
     *  Our plan for how to approach WorldGeneration algorithm:
     *  Step 1.) Randomly generate rooms
     *  Step 2.) Iterate through all rooms
     *  Step 3.) Iterate through perimeter, see if rooms can be connected to a wall away from them.
     *  Step 4.) At end, any unconnected rooms should be connected **SOMEHOW (hallways that turn?)
     *      > This step might not be needed; included in Step 5.) (?)
     *  Step 5.) After all/most rooms connected, make some random hallways that turn and dead-end
