My partner and I are late to submit Project 2 Phase 1 because neither of us were able to start
working on it until last Friday.

Both of us had family visiting that took up time and prior commitments before this project was on the horizon
that we had to attend to.

Despite cramming all weekend, we weren't able to finish in time T_T

We are currently working on our 3rd new approach to how to generate a random world. Have mercy on our crushed souls.
